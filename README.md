# Install Node Package Manager

![](/screenshot.png)

This is a shell script when ran on a linux compatible terminal would allow one to install the node package manager of choice.

Currently, the node package manager supports:

- Yarn Berry
- Pnpm

`npm` is omitted because this is the pre-requisite for now.

## OTA Installation

curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ruchernchong/install-node-package-manager/main/install.sh | bash
